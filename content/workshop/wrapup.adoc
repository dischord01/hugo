== Wrap Up, Q&A, and Free Style

That wraps up what we have planned for today.

What do you think? How can we help you understand Containers better?

For more indepth overview and examples for working with containers and RHEL check out link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/7/single/getting-started-with-containers/[this link]

Thank you for your time and participation!
