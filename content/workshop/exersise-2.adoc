== Exercise Two - Pulling Docker Images


=== Pull Images

.Docker pull command
[source]
----
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel
----

An image is identified by a repository name (registry.access.redhat.com), a namespace name (rhel7) and the image name (rhel). You could also add a tag (which defaults to :latest if not entered). The repository name rhel, when passed to the docker pull command without the name of a registry preceding it, is ambiguous and could result in the retrieval of an image that originates from an untrusted registry. If there are multiple versions of the same image, adding a tag, such as latest to form a name such as rhel:latest, lets you choose the image more explicitly.

.Docker images command
[source]
----
# docker images
REPOSITORY                              TAG       IMAGE ID        CREATED       SIZE
registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel   latest    98a88a8b722a    5 weeks ago   201.4 MB

=== Inspecting the Docker environment
Now that you have the docker and docker-distribution services running, with a few containers available, you can start investigating the Docker environment and looking into what makes up a container. Run docker with the version and info options to get a feel for your Docker environment.

.Docker version command
[source]
